# Python Program to find the area and perimeter of a rectangle  

# Taking input from the user
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
breadth = float(input("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: "))
# Calculating the area  
area = length * breadth

    # Calculating the perimeter
perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)

 # Displaying the output
print("The area of the rectangle is: ", area)
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is: ", perimeter)
